I am a intensivist and scientist working in Toronto, Canada. This website is in progress.

Clinically, I work in the intensive care units at the Scarborough Health Network. 

Academically, I conduct research focused on improving the quality and equity of care in respiratory failure.

We are building research capacity at the Scarborough Health Network. I'm keen to hear from any potentially interested collaborators, health professionals, data scientists, or patient partners who share my conviction that we can do innovative, inclusive, practice-changing research in Scarborough!
