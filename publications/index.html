Invasive ventilation is an important treatment initiated based on expert opinion. It is unknown whether use of invasive ventilation varies by patient race and ethnicity. Objective: To measure (1) the association between patient race and ethnicity and the use of invasive ventilation and (2) the change in 28-day mortality mediated by any association. Methods: We performed a multicenter cohort study of non-intubated adults receiving oxygen within 24 hours of intensive care admission using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, 2008-2019) and Phillips eICU (eICU, 2014-2015) databases from the United States of America. We modeled the association between patient race and ethnicity (Asian, Black, Hispanic, white) and invasive ventilation rate using a Bayesian multistate model that adjusted for baseline and time-varying covariates, calculated hazard ratios, and estimated 28-day hospital mortality changes mediated by differential invasive ventilation use. We reported posterior means and 95% credible intervals (CrI). Results: We studied 38,258 patients, 52% (20,032) from MIMIC-IV and 48% (18,226) from eICU; 2% Asian (892), 11% Black (4,289), 5% Hispanic (1,964), and 81% white (31,113). Invasive ventilation occurred in 9.2% (3,511), and 7.5% (2,869) died. The adjusted rate of invasive ventilation was lower in Asian (HR 0.82, CrI 0.70 to 0.95), Black (HR 0.78, CrI 0.71 to 0.86), and Hispanic (HR 0.70, CrI 0.61 to 0.79) patients as compared to white patients. For the average patient, lower rates of invasive ventilation did not mediate differences in 28-day mortality. For a patient on high-flow nasal cannula with inspired oxygen fraction of 1.0, the odds ratios for mortality if invasive ventilation rates were equal to the rate for white patients were: 0.97 (CrI 0.91 to 1.03) for Asian patients, 0.96 (CrI 0.91 to 1.03) for Black patients, and 0.94 (CrI 0.89 to 1.01) for Hispanic patients. Conclusions: Asian, Black, and Hispanic patients had lower rates of invasive ventilation than white patients. These decreases did not mediate harm for the average patient, but we could not rule out harm for patients with more severe hypoxemia.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="boglerAssociationDiabetesMortality2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Association Between Diabetes and Mortality Among Adult Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19: A Cohort Study of Hospitalized Adults in Ontario, Canada, and Copenhagen, Denmark</div> <div class="author"> Orly Bogler, Afsaneh Raissi, Michael Colacci, Andrea Beaman, Tor Biering-Sørensen, Alex Cressman, Allan Detsky, Alexi Gosset, Mats Højbjerg Lassen, Chris Kandel, Yaariv Khaykin, David Barbosa, Lauren Lapointe-Shaw, Derek R.

However, the available studies lack detail on COVID-19 illness severity and measurement of relevant comorbidities. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, retrospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age and older who were hospitalized with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020, and November 30, 2020, in Ontario, Canada, and Copenhagen, Denmark. Chart abstraction emphasizing comorbidities and disease severity was performed by trained research personnel. The association between diabetes and death was measured using Poisson regression. The main outcome measure was in-hospital 30-day risk of death. RESULTS: Our study included 1,133 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Ontario and 305 in Denmark, of whom 405 and 75 patients, respectively, had pre-existing diabetes. In both Ontario and Denmark, patients with diabetes were more likely to be older; have chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and higher troponin levels; and be receiving antibiotics, when compared with adults without diabetes. In Ontario, 24% (n=96) of adults with diabetes died compared with 15% (n=109) of adults without diabetes. In Denmark, 16% (n=12) of adults with diabetes died in hospital compared with 13% (n=29) of those without diabetes. In Ontario, the crude mortality ratio among patients with diabetes was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24 to 2.07) and in the adjusted regression model it was 1.19 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.66). In Denmark, the crude mortality ratio among patients with diabetes was 1.27 (95% CI, 0.68 to 2.36) and in the adjusted model it was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.49 to 1.54). Meta-analysis of the 2 rate ratios from each region resulted in a crude mortality ratio of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.22 to 1.96) and an adjusted mortality ratio of 1.11 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.47). CONCLUSION: The presence of diabetes was not strongly associated with in-hospital COVID-19 mortality independent of illness severity and other comorbidities.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="doidgeItTimeTrial2023a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">It’s Time for a Trial of the Timing of Invasive Ventilation in COVID-19 and Other Pneumonias</div> <div class="author"> James C.

Objectives: To evaluate the association between postextubation noninvasive respiratory support and reintubation in patients with ABI being liberated from mechanical ventilation. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of a prospective, observational study of mechanically ventilated patients with ABI (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT 03400904). The primary endpoint was reintubation during ICU admission. We used mixed-effects logistic regression models with patient-level covariates and random intercepts for hospital and country to evaluate the association between prophylactic (i.e., planned) HFNC or NIPPV and reintubation. Measurements and Main Results: 1,115 patients were included from 62 hospitals and 19 countries, of whom 267 received HFNC or NIPPV following extubation (23.9%). Compared with conventional oxygen therapy, neither prophylactic HFNC nor NIPPV was associated with decreased odds of reintubation (respectively, odds ratios of 0.97 [95% confidence interval, 0.54–1.73] and 0.63 [0.30–1.32]). Findings remained consistent in sensitivity analyses accounting for alternate adjustment procedures, missing data, shorter time frames of the primary endpoint, and competing risks precluding reintubation. In a Bayesian analysis using skeptical and data-driven priors, the probabilities of reduced reintubation ranged from 17% to 34% for HFNC and from 46% to 74% for NIPPV. Conclusions: In a large cohort of brain-injured patients undergoing liberation from mechanical ventilation, prophylactic use of HFNC and NIPPV were not associated with reintubation. Prospective trials are needed to confirm treatment effects in this population.

Design: Model-based cost-utility estimation with individual-level simulation and value-of-information analysis. Setting: Critical care units. Participants: Adults admitted to critical care receiving non-invasive oxygen. Interventions: We compared four strategies: initiation of invasive ventilation at thresholds of saturation-to-inspired oxygen fraction ratio (SF) &lt; 110, &lt; 98, or &lt; 88, and usual care. Main results: An invasive ventilation initiation threshold of SF &lt; 110, compared to usual care, resulted in more predicted invasive ventilation (62% vs 31%), hospital survival (78.4% vs 75.5%), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (8.48 vs 8.34), and lifetime costs (86,700 Canadian dollars (CAD) vs 75,600 CAD). Among the four strategies, threshold SF &lt; 110 had the highest expected net monetary benefit (761,000 CAD), but there was significant uncertainty, because all four strategies had similar probability (range: 23.5% to 27.5%) of having the best net monetary benefit. The expected value to society over the next 10 years of a 400-person randomized trial of oxygenation thresholds was 4.27 billion CAD, and remained high (2.64 billion CAD) in a scenario analysis considering a hypothetical threshold that resulted in less invasive ventilation and similar survival compared to usual care. Conclusion: The preferred threshold to initiate invasive ventilation in hypoxemic respiratory failure is uncertain. It would be highly valuable to society to identify thresholds that, in comparison to usual care, either improve survival or reduce invasive ventilation without reducing survival.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="yarnellInterpretingPosteriorProbabilities2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Interpreting Posterior Probabilities in Bayesian Analyses of Clinical Trials</div> <div class="author"> Christopher J.

Physiologic thresholds standardize the use of invasive ventilation in clinical trials, but it is unknown whether thresholds prompt invasive ventilation in clinical practice. Objectives: In patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, measure the probability of invasive ventilation within 3 hours after meeting physiologic thresholds. Methods: We studied patients admitted to intensive care receiving inspired oxygen of 0.4 or more via non-rebreather mask, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, or high-flow nasal cannula, using data from MIMIC-IV (2008-2019) and AmsterdamUMCdb (2003-2016). We evaluated seventeen thresholds, including the arterial-to-inspired oxygen(P:F) ratio, the saturation-to-inspired oxygen(S:F) ratio, composite scores, and criteria from randomized trials. We report the probability of invasive ventilation within 3 hours of meeting each threshold and its association with covariates using odds ratios (OR) and 95% credible intervals (CrI). Results: We studied 4,726 patients (3,365 MIMIC, 1,361 AmsterdamUMCdb). Invasive ventilation occurred in 28% (1,320). In MIMIC, the highest probability of invasive ventilation within 3 hours of meeting a threshold was 20%, after meeting prespecified neurologic or respiratory criteria while on vasopressors, and 19%, after a P:F ratio less than 80mmHg. In AmsterdamUMCdb, the highest probability was 34%, after vasopressor initiation, and 25%, after an S:F ratio less than 90. The probability after meeting the threshold from randomized trials was 9% (MIMIC) and 13% (AmsterdamUMCdb). In MIMIC, a race/ethnicity of Black (OR 0.75, CrI 0.57-0.96) or Asian (OR 0.6, CrI 0.35-0.95) compared to white was associated with decreased probability of invasive ventilation after meeting a threshold. Conclusions: The probability of invasive ventilation within 3 hours of meeting physiologic thresholds was low and associated with patient race/ethnicity.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="yarnellTransfusionStrategiesPragmatic2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Transfusion Strategies and the Pragmatic Appeal of Bayesian Analysis for Trauma Research</div> <div class="author"> Christopher J.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional web-based survey consisting of (1) a survey of the personal and professional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and potential mitigation strategies, and (2) two validated psychological instruments (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale [K10] and Impact of Events Scale Revised [IES-R]). Regression analyses were conducted to identify the predictors of workplace stress, psychological distress, and post-traumatic stress. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Hospital workers employed at 4 teaching and 8 non-teaching hospitals in Ontario, Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Among 1875 respondents (84% female, 49% frontline workers), 72% feared falling ill, 64% felt their job placed them at great risk of COVID-19 exposure, and 48% felt little control over the risk of infection. Respondents perceived that others avoided them (61%), reported increased workplace stress (80%), workload (66%) and responsibilities (59%), and 44% considered leaving their job. The psychological questionnaires revealed that 25% had at least some psychological distress on the K10, 50% had IES-R scores suggesting clinical concern for post-traumatic stress, and 38% fulfilled criteria for at least one psychological diagnosis. Female gender and feeling at increased risk due to PPE predicted all adverse psychological outcomes. Respondents favoured clear hospital communication (59%), knowing their voice is heard (55%), expressions of appreciation from leadership (55%), having COVID-19 protocols (52%), and food and beverages provided by the hospital (50%).

We used a multivariable multilevel regression model to compare the in-hospital mortality risk across hospitals and quantify the variation attributable to patient-level factors. RESULTS: There were 1364 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in Ontario (n\,= 1149) and in Denmark (n\,= 215). In Ontario, the absolute risk of in-hospital mortality ranged from 12.0% to 39.8% across hospitals. Ninety-eight percent of the variation in mortality in Ontario was explained by differences in the characteristics of the patients. In Denmark, the absolute risk of inpatients ranged from 13.8% to 20.6%. One hundred percent of the variation in mortality in Denmark was explained by differences in the characteristics of the inpatients. CONCLUSION: There was wide variation in inpatient COVID-19 mortality across hospitals, which was largely explained by patient-level factors, such as age and severity of presenting illness. However, hospital-level factors that could have affected care, including resource availability and capacity, were not taken into account. These findings highlight potential limitations in comparing crude mortality rates across hospitals for the purposes of reporting on the quality of care.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="resendeClinicalDecisionAnalysis2022a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Clinical Decision Analysis of Elective Delivery vs Expectant Management for Pregnant Individuals with COVID-19–Related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</div> <div class="author"> Maura H.

There is a lack of high-quality evidence on whether elective delivery or expectant management leads to better maternal and neonatal outcomes. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine whether elective delivery or expectant management are associated with higher quality-adjusted life expectancy for pregnant individuals with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome and their neonates. STUDY DESIGN We performed a clinical decision analysis using a patient-level model in which we simulatedpregnant individuals and their unborn children. We used a patient-level model with parallel open-cohort structure, daily cycle length, continuous discounting, lifetime horizon, sensitivity analyses for key parameter values, and 1000 iterations for quantification of uncertainty. We simulated pregnant individuals at 32 weeks of gestation, invasively ventilated because of COVID-19–related acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the elective delivery strategy, pregnant individuals received immediate cesarean delivery. In the expectant management strategy, pregnancies continued until spontaneous labor or obstetrical decision to deliver. For both pregnant individuals and neonates, model outputs were hospital or perinatal survival, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy denominated in years, summarized by the mean and 95% credible interval. Maternal utilities incorporated neonatal outcomes in accordance with best practices in perinatal decision analysis. RESULTS Model outputs for pregnant individuals were similar when comparing elective delivery at 32 weeks’ gestation with expectant management, including hospital survival (87.1% vs 87.4%), life-years (difference, -0.1; 95% credible interval, -1.4 to 1.1), and quality-adjusted life expectancy denominated in years (difference, -0.1; 95% credible interval, -1.3 to 1.1). For neonates, elective delivery at 32 weeks’ gestation was estimated to lead to a higher perinatal survival (98.4% vs 93.2%; difference, 5.2%; 95% credible interval, 3.5–7), similar life-years (difference, 0.9; 95% credible interval, -0.9 to 2.8), and higher quality-adjusted life expectancy denominated in years (difference, 1.3; 95% credible interval, 0.4–2.2). For pregnant individuals, elective delivery was not superior to expectant management across a range of scenarios between 28 and 34 weeks of gestation. Elective delivery in cases where intrauterine death or maternal mortality were more likely resulted in higher neonatal quality-adjusted life expectancy, as did elective delivery at 30 weeks’ gestation (difference, 1.1 years; 95% credible interval, 0.1 – 2.1) despite higher long-term complications (4.3% vs 0.5%; difference, 3.7%; 95% credible interval, 2.4–5.1), and in cases where intrauterine death or maternal acute respiratory distress syndrome mortality were more likely. CONCLUSION The decision to pursue elective delivery vs expectant management in pregnant individuals with COVID-19–related acute respiratory distress syndrome should be guided by gestational age, risk of intrauterine death, and maternal acute respiratory distress syndrome severity. For the pregnant individual, elective delivery is comparable but not superior to expectant management for gestational ages from 28 to 34 weeks. For neonates, elective delivery was superior if gestational age was ≥30 weeks and if the rate of intrauterine death or maternal mortality risk were high. We recommend basing the decision for elective delivery vs expectant management in a pregnant individual with COVID-19–related acute respiratory distress syndrome on gestational age and likelihood of intrauterine or maternal death.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="yarnellcjWhatThresholdsInvasive2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">What Thresholds for Invasive Ventilation in Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure Are Used in Routine Clinical Care?

In response-adaptive randomization, allocation ratios are adjusted according to interim analyses to assign more patients to promising interventions. Although it is known that response-adaptive randomization may give biased estimates if outcome rates drift over time, observed mortality fluctuations in the COVID-19 pandemic are more extreme than any previously tested in simulation. We hypothesized that pandemic surges induce bias in trials using response-adaptive randomization, and that adjustment for time will alleviate that bias. Bayesian 4-arm superiority trials with a mortality outcome were simulated to investigate bias in treatment effect, comparing complete and response-adaptive randomization under different pandemic scenarios based on data from New York, Spain, and Italy. Relative bias in the odds ratio associated with treatment ranged from 0.3% to 11% and was largest in trials with a surge and an effective intervention that did not adjust for time. Bias was attenuated by adjustment for time without compromising the false-positive rate. Trials using response-adaptive randomization were more likely to identify effective interventions but were slower to drop ineffective interventions. Even with variation in outcome rates similar to observed pandemic surges, COVID-19 trials using response-adaptive randomization that adjust for time can provide accurate estimates of treatment effects.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="yarnellNoninvasiveRespiratoryStrategies2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Noninvasive Respiratory Strategies and Intubation or Mortality Among Patients With Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure Due to COVID-19</div> <div class="author"> Christopher J.

Objectives: To determine whether the mortality benefit of ventilation with lower Vt varies according to Ers. Methods: In a secondary analysis of patients from five randomized trials of lower- versus higher-Vt ventilation strategies in ARDS and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, the posterior probability of an interaction between the randomized Vt strategy and Ers on 60-day mortality was computed using Bayesian multivariable logistic regression. Measurements and Main Results: Of 1,096 patients available for analysis, 416 (38%) died by Day 60. The posterior probability that the mortality benefit from lower-Vt ventilation strategies varied with Ers was 93% (posterior median interaction odds ratio, 0.80 per cm H2O/[ml/kg]; 90% credible interval, 0.63–1.02). Ers was classified as low (&lt;2 cm H2O/[ml/kg], n\,= 321, 32%), intermediate (2–3 cm H2O/[ml/kg], n\,= 475, 46%), and high (&gt;3 cm H2O/[ml/kg], n\,= 224, 22%). In these groups, the posterior probabilities of an absolute risk reduction in mortality\,≥ 1% were 55%, 82%, and 92%, respectively. The posterior probabilities of an absolute risk reduction\,≥ 5% were 29%, 58%, and 82%, respectively. Conclusions: The mortality benefit of ventilation with lower Vt in ARDS varies according to elastance, suggesting that lung-protective ventilation strategies should primarily target driving pressure rather than Vt.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="nayfehEvaluatingSatisfactionQuality2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Evaluating Satisfaction with the Quality and Provision of End-of-Life Care for Patients from Diverse Ethnocultural Backgrounds</div> <div class="author"> Ayah Nayfeh, Christopher J.

Many clinicians might be sceptical that Bayesian analysis, a philosophical and statistical approach that combines prior beliefs with data to generate probabilities, provides more useful information about clinical trials than the frequentist approach. In this Personal View, we introduce clinicians to the rationale, process, and interpretation of Bayesian analysis through a systematic review and reanalysis of interventional trials in critical illness. In the majority of cases, Bayesian and frequentist analyses agreed. In the remainder, Bayesian analysis identified interventions where benefit was probable despite the absence of statistical significance, where interpretation depended substantially on choice of prior distribution, and where benefit was improbable despite statistical significance. Bayesian analysis in critical care medicine can help to distinguish harm from uncertainty and establish the probability of clinically important benefit for clinicians, policy makers, and patients.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="yarnellObservationalStudyAgreement2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Observational Study of Agreement between Attending and Trainee Physicians on the Surprise Question: “Would You Be Surprised If This Patient Died in the next 12 Months?”</div> <div class="author"> Christopher J.

The extent to which attending physicians and trainee physicians agree on the prognoses of their patients is unknown. We investigated agreement between attending and trainee physician on the surprise question: “Would you be surprised if this patient died in the next 12 months?”, a question intended to assess mortality risk and unmet palliative care needs. Methods This was a multicentre prospective cohort study of general internal medicine patients at 7 tertiary academic hospitals in Ontario, Canada. General internal medicine attending and senior trainee physician dyads were asked the surprise question for each of the patients for whom they were responsible. Surprise question response agreement was quantified by Cohen’s kappa using Bayesian multilevel modeling to account for clustering by physician dyad. Mortality was recorded at 12 months. Results Surprise question responses encompassed 546 patients from 30 attending-trainee physician dyads on academic general internal medicine teams at 7 tertiary academic hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Patients had median age 75 years (IQR 60–85), 260 (48%) were female, and 138 (25%) were dependent for some or all activities of daily living. Trainee and attending physician responses agreed in 406 (75%) patients with adjusted Cohen’s kappa of 0.54 (95% credible interval 0.41 to 0.66). Vital status was confirmed for 417 (76%) patients of whom 160 (38% of 417) had died. Using a response of “No” to predict 12-month mortality had positive likelihood ratios of 1.84 (95% CrI 1.55 to 2.22, trainee physicians) and 1.51 (95% CrI 1.30 to 1.72, attending physicians), and negative likelihood ratios of 0.31 (95% CrI 0.17 to 0.48, trainee physicians) and 0.25 (95% CrI 0.10 to 0.46, attending physicians). Conclusion Trainee and attending physician responses to the surprise question agreed in 54% of cases after correcting for chance agreement. Physicians had similar discriminative accuracy; both groups had better accuracy predicting which patients would survive as opposed to which patients would die. Different opinions of a patient’s prognosis may contribute to confusion for patients and missed opportunities for engagement with palliative care services.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="yarnellSeeingInterventionsFavorable2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Seeing Interventions in a Favorable Light: The Consequences of Unblinded Trials</div> <div class="author"> Christopher J.

However, most studies have focused on end-of-life care of white, Hispanic and black patients. We sought to compare end-of-life care delivered to people of Chinese and South Asian ethnicity with that delivered to others from the general population, in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, we included all people who died in Ontario, Canada, between Apr. 1, 2004, and Mar. 31, 2015. People were identified as having Chinese or South Asian ethnicity on the basis of a validated surname algorithm. We used modified Poisson regression analyses to assess location of death and care received in the last 6 months of life. RESULTS: We analyzed 967 339 decedents, including 18 959 (2.0%) of Chinese and 11 406 (1.2%) of South Asian ethnicity. Chinese (13.6%) and South Asian (18.5%) decedents were more likely than decedents from the general population (10.1%) to die in the intensive care unit (ICU). The adjusted relative risk of dying in intensive care was 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15 to 1.27) for Chinese and 1.25 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.30) for South Asian decedents. In their last 6 months of life, decedents of Chinese and South Asian ethnicity experienced significantly more ICU admission, hospital admission, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, percutaneous feeding tube placement, tracheostomy and cardiopulmonary resuscitation than the general population. INTERPRETATION: Decedents of Chinese and South Asian ethnicity in Ontario were more likely than decedents from the general population to receive aggressive care and to die in an ICU. These findings may be due to communication difficulties between patients and clinicians, differences in preferences about end-of-life care or differences in access to palliative care services.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="yarnellBayesianAnalysisCritical2020a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Bayesian Analysis in Critical Care Medicine</div> <div class="author"> C.J.

The median odds ratio and analogues are useful intuitive measures available to communicate variability in outcomes across clusters using the variance of random intercepts from a multilevel regression model. However, the median odds ratio cannot describe variability across clusters for different patient subgroups because the random intercepts do not vary by subgroup. To empower investigators interested in equity and other applications of this scenario, we describe an extension of the median odds ratio to multilevel regression models employing both random intercepts and random coefficients. By example, we conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of variation in care limitations (goals of care preferences) according to ethnicity in patients admitted to intensive care. Using mixed-effects logistic regression clustered by hospital, we demonstrated that patients of non-Caucasian ethnicity were less likely to have care limitations but experienced similar variability across hospitals. Limitations of the extended median odds ratio include the large sample sizes and computational power needed for models with random coefficients. This extension of the median odds ratio to multilevel regression models with random coefficients will provide insight into cluster-level variability for researchers interested in equity and other phenomena where variability by patient subgroup is important.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="yarnellAssociationImmigrantStatus2017" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Association between Immigrant Status and End-of-Life Care in Ontario, Canada</div> <div class="author"> Christopher J.

OBJECTIVE To examine end-of-life care provided to immigrants to Canada in the last 6 months of their life. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cohort study (April 1, 2004, to March 31, 2015) included 967 013 decedents in Ontario, Canada, using validated linkages between health and immigration databases to identify immigrant (since 1985) and long-standing resident cohorts. EXPOSURES All decedents who immigrated to Canada between 1985 and 2015 were classified as recent immigrants, with subgroup analyses assessing the association of time since immigration, and region of birth, with end-of-life care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Location of death and intensity of care received in the last 6 months of life. Analysis included modified Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations, adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic position, causes of death, urban and rural residence, and preexisting comorbidities. RESULTS Among 967 013 decedents of whom 47 514 (5%) immigrated since 1985, sex, socioeconomic status, urban (vs rural) residence, and causes of death were similar, while long-standing residents were older than immigrant decedents (median [interquartile range] age, 75 [58-84] vs 80 [68-87] years). Recent immigrant decedents were overall more likely to die in intensive care (15.6%vs 10.0%; difference, 5.6%; 95%CI, 5.2%-5.9%) after adjusting for differences in age, sex, income, geography, and cause of death (relative risk, 1.30; 95%CI, 1.27-1.32). In their last 6 months of life, recent immigrant decedents experienced more intensive care admissions (24.9% vs 19.2%; difference, 5.7%; 95%CI, 5.3%-6.1%), hospital admissions (72.1% vs 68.2%; difference, 3.9%; 95%CI, 3.5%-4.3%), mechanical ventilation (21.5%vs 13.6%; difference, 7.9%; 95%CI, 7.5%-8.3%), dialysis (5.5%vs 3.4%; difference, 2.1%; 95%CI, 1.9%-2.3%), percutaneous feeding tube placement (5.5%vs 3.0%; difference, 2.5%; 95%CI, 2.3%-2.8%), and tracheostomy (2.3%vs 1.1%; difference, 1.2%; 95%CI, 1.1%-1.4%). Relative risk of dying in intensive care for recent immigrants compared with long-standing residents varied according to recent immigrant region of birth from 0.84 (95% CI, 0.74-0.95) among those born in Northern andWestern Europe to 1.96 (95%CI, 1.89-2.05) among those born in South Asia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among decedents in Ontario, Canada, recent immigrants were significantly more likely to receive aggressive care and to die in an intensive care unit compared with other residents.

We excluded patients discharged for a surgical, obstetrical, or psychiatric diagnosis. We used time-to-event analysis and time-series analysis to compare rates of readmission prior to and after the physician call system change (January 1, 2009). Results A total of 89,697 patients were discharged, of whom 10,001 (11%) were subsequently readmitted and 4280 died.

Time-series analysis confirmed a 26% increase in the readmission rate after call system change (95% confidence interval, 22%-31%; P &lt;.001). The increase in readmission rate after call system change persisted across patients with diverse ages, estimated readmission risks, and medical diagnoses. The net effect was equal to 7240 additional patient days in the hospital following call system change. A modest increase was observed at a nearby acute care hospital that did not change physician call system, and no increase in risk of death was observed with increased hospital readmissions. Conclusion We suggest that changes in physician call systems sometimes increase subsequent hospital readmission rates. Further reductions in readmissions may instead require additional resources or ingenuity.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2012</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="redelmeierLethalMisconceptionsInterpretation2012" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Lethal Misconceptions: Interpretation and Bias in Studies of Traffic Deaths</div> <div class="author"> Donald A.

We argue that such a high threshold is inappropriate when interpreting traffic death studies in clinical epidemiology research. We review 10 concepts that emphasize the value of modest effect sizes by taking into account the baseline frequency, nonfatal disability, numbers needed to treat, shared responsibility, event diversity, behavioral offsets, measurement error, indirect reinforcement, delayed progression, and economic affordability. An awareness of these concepts may help when interpreting effect sizes in studies of traffic deaths. \textcopyright 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We assessed the association between medical warnings and the risk of subsequent road crashes.}n}nMETHODS: We identified consecutive patients who received a medical warning in Ontario, Canada, between April 1, 2006, and December 31, 2009, from a physician who judged them to be potentially unfit to drive. We excluded patients who were younger than 18 years of age, who were not residents of Ontario, or who lacked valid health-card numbers under universal health insurance. We analyzed emergency department visits for road crashes during a baseline interval before the warning and a subsequent interval after the warning.}n}nRESULTS: A total of 100,075 patients received a medical warning from a total of 6098 physicians. During the 3-year baseline interval, there were 1430 road crashes in which the patient was a driver and presented to the emergency department, as compared with 273 road crashes during the 1-year subsequent interval, representing a reduction of approximately 45% in the annual rate of crashes per 1000 patients after the warning (4.76 vs. 2.73, P&lt;0.001). The lower rate was observed across patients with diverse characteristics. No significant change was observed in subsequent crashes in which patients were pedestrians or passengers. Medical warnings were associated with an increase in subsequent emergency department visits for depression and a decrease in return visits to the responsible physician.}n}nCONCLUSIONS: Physicians’ warnings to patients who are potentially unfit to drive may contribute to a decrease in subsequent trauma from road crashes, yet they may also exacerbate mood disorders and compromise the doctor-patient relationship.

Tax payments influence the long-term health of the economy, but no study has tested how tax deadlines might affect the immediate health of individuals. We investigated the number of individuals involved in a fatal road crash on tax day under the prespecified hypothesis that stressful deadlines might increase the risk of road trauma by impairing drivers or by compromising surrounding individuals from making compensatory adjustments.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Christopher J.
